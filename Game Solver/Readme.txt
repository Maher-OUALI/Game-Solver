This project is a GUI made using the Tkinter library in python
It's a game solver where you enter either a sudoku grid or a wordsearch puzzle
There are two ways of entering a game either by selecting an image or taking a photo or by typing letters/words/numbers manually
The OCR isn't functioning very well and it need to be enhanced in some way maybe using some image pre-processing before passing it through the OCR library
This is a first version and many enhancements could be applied to make it work even better.
Enjoy :)
